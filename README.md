# Smart-Blind-Stick-

The main objective of this project is to design a simple, effective, and low-cost 
smart blind stick for blind people to detect the obstacles in various directions, 
temperatures, and Day/Night to make blind persons free to walk. 
❖ I developed a tool that can serve as a smart blind stick being more efficient and 
helpful than the conventional one.
❖ Currently, there are thousands of blind people all over the globe. These include 
people from low sightseeing to complete loss of vision. They find it very difficult 
while crossing the road or reaching their respective destination with the help of 
any other individual. The traditional stick cannot help to detect the obstacles in 
front of the potholes in the way. It is outdated. Hence there is a need to update 
it using today's technology
